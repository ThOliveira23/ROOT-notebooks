    "Now that you have installed ROOT, what iss this interactive shell thing you’re running ? It is like this: ROOT leads a double life. It has an interpreter for macros Cling that you can run from the command line or like other applications. But it is also an interactive shell that can evaluate arbitrary statements and expressions. This is extremely useful for debugging, quick hacking and testing. In the notebook environment you will have a similar prompt allowing you to run ROOT commands straight from your browser. Let us first have a look at some very simple examples."

    "\n",
    "You know how other books go on and on about programming fundamentals and finally work up to building a complete, working program? Let’s skip all that. In this guide, we will describe macros executed by the ROOT C++ interpreter Cling.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is relatively easy to compile a macro, either as a pre-compiled library to load into ROOT, or as a stand-alone application, by adding some include statements for header file or some “dressing code” to any macro.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 General Remarks on ROOT macros\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a number of lines which you were able to execute at the ROOT prompt, they can be turned into a ROOT macro by giving them a name which corresponds to the file name without extension. The general structure for a macro stored in file ```MacroName.C``` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "void MacroName() {\n",
    "        <          ...\n",
    "          your lines of C++ code\n",
    "                   ...             >\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The macro is executed by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "> root MacroName.C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "at the system prompt, or executed using ```Bash .x``` at the ROOT prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh \n",
    "> root \n",
    "root [0] .x MacroName.C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```sh\n",
    "root [0].L MacroName.C\n",
    "root [1] MacroName();\n",
    "```\n",
    "at the ROOT prompt. The notebook environment is very similar. You can run a macro by typing:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "MacroName();\n",
    "```\n",
    "on a new notebook cell. Note that more than one macro can be loaded this way, as each macro has a unique name in the ROOT name space. A small set of options can help making your plot nicer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "gROOT->SetStyle(\"Plain\");   // set plain TStyle\n",
    "gStyle->SetOptStat(111111); // draw statistics on plots,\n",

    "gStyle->SetOptTitle(0);     // suppress title box\n",
    "```\n",

    "Next, you should create a canvas for graphical output, with size, subdivisions and format suitable to your needs, see documentation of class ```TCanvas```:\n",

    "canvas_3_1.cd(1); \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These parts of a well-written macro are pretty standard, and you should remember to include pieces of code like in the examples above to make sure your plots always look as you had intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, in section Interpretation and Compilation, some more code fragments will be shown, allowing you to use the system compiler to compile macros for more efficient execution, or turn macros into stand-alone applications linked against the ROOT libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 A more complete example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now look at a rather complete example of a typical task in data analysis, a macro that constructs a graph with errors, fits a (linear) model to it and saves it as an image. To run this macro, simply type in the shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " > root macro1.C\n",
    "```\n",

    "The code is built around the ROOT class ```TGraphErrors```, which was already introduced previously. Have a look at it in the class reference guide, where you will also find further examples. The macro shown below uses additional classes, ```TF1``` to define a function, TCanvas to define size and properties of the window used for our plot, and ```TLegend``` to add a nice legend. For the moment, ignore the commented include statements for header files, they will only become important at the end in section Interpretation and Compilation."

The constructor takes the number of points and the pointers to the arrays of x values, y values, x errors (in this case none, represented by the NULL pointer) and y errors.

It is more interesting to look at the output on the screen to see the parameters values and other crucial information that we will learn to read at the end of this guide. The DrawClone comand tha follows draws the clone of the object on the canvas again. The “Same” option avoids the cancellation of the already drawn objects, in our case, the graph. The function f will be drawn using the same axis system defined by the previously drawn graph.\n",

    "* **Point #9:** completes the plot with a legend, represented by a TLegend instance. The constructor takes the lower left and upper right corners coordinates with respect to the total size of the canvas, assumed to be 1, and the legend header string, as parameters. You can add to the legend the objects, previously drawn or not drawn, through the addEntry method. Observe how the legend is drawn at the end: looks familiar now, right ?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Point #10:** defines an arrow with a triangle on the right hand side, a thickness of 2 and draws it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Point #11:** interpret a Latex string which hast its lower left corner located in the specified coordinate. The #splitline{}{} construct allows to store multiple lines in the same TLatex object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Point #12:** save the canvas as image. The format is automatically inferred from the file extension (it could have been eps, gif, …).\n",

    "## 3.3 Interpretation and Compilation\n",
    "As you observed, up to now we heavily exploited the capabilities of ROOT for interpreting our code, more than compiling and then executing. This is sufficient for a wide range of applications, but you might have already asked yourself “how can this code be compiled in my prompt?”. There are two answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.1 Compile a Macro with ACLiC\n",
    "\n",
    "[ACLiC](https://root.cern.ch/compiling-your-code-also-known-aclic) will create for you a compiled dynamic library for your macro, without any effort from your side, except the insertion of the appropriate header files at the top of the code. In this example, they are already included. To generate an object library from the macro code, from inside the interpreter type (please note the “+”):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    " root [1] .L macro1.C+\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once this operation is accomplished, the macro symbols will be available in memory and you will be able to execute it simply by calling from inside the interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "root [2] macro1()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.2 Compile a Macro with the Compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "A plethora of excellent compilers are available, both free and commercial. We will refer to the [```GCC```](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/) compiler in the following. In this case, you have to include the appropriate headers in the code and then exploit the root-config tool for the automatic settings of all the compiler flags. root-config is a script that comes with ROOT; it prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with the ROOT libraries. In order to make the code executable stand-alone, an entry point for the operating system is needed, in C++ this is the procedure ```int main();```. The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into a stand-alone application is to add the following “dressing code” at the end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose of which is to call your macro:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "  ExampleMacro();\n",
    "  return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a stand-alone program from a macro called ```ExampleMacro.C```, simply type\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    " > g++ -o ExampleMacro ExampleMacro.C 'root-config --cflags --libs'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and execute it by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    " > ./ExampleMacro\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure will, however, not give access to the ROOT graphics, as neither control of mouse or keyboard events nor access to the graphics windows of ROOT is available. If you want your stand-alone application have display graphics output and respond to mouse and keyboard, a slightly more complex piece of code can be used. In the example below, a macro ```ExampleMacro_GUI``` is executed by the ROOT class [```TApplication```](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTApplication.html). As a additional feature, this code example offers access to parameters eventually passed to the program when started from the command line. Here is the code fragment:"

    "# 4 ROOT Beginners’ FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point of the guide, some basic questions could have already come to your mind. We will try to clarify some of them with further explanations in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 ROOT type declarations for basic data types\n",
    "\n",
    "In the official ROOT documentation, you find special data types replacing the normal ones, e.g. ```Double_t```, ```Float_t``` or ```Int_t``` replacing the standard ```double```, ```float``` or ```int``` types. Using the ROOT types makes it easier to port code between platforms (64/32 bit) or operating systems (windows/Linux), as these types are mapped to suitable ones in the ROOT header files. If you want adaptive code of this type, use the ROOT type declarations. However, usually you do not need such adaptive code, and you can safely use the standard C type declarations for your private code, as we did and will do throughout this guide. If you intend to become a ROOT developer, however, you better stick to the official coding rules!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Configure ROOT at start-up\n",
    "\n",
    "The behaviour of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the ```.rootrc``` file. Examples of the tunable parameters are the ones related to the operating and window system, to the fonts to be used and to the location of start-up files. At start-up, ROOT looks for a ```.rootrc``` file in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```./.rootrc //local directory```\n",
    "* ```$HOME/.rootrc //user directory```\n",
    "* ```$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc //global ROOT directory```\n",
    "\n",
    "If more than one ```.rootrc``` file is in the search paths above, the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. The parsing and interpretation of this file is handled by the ROOT class TEnv. Have a look at its documentation if you need such rather advanced features. The file ```.rootrc``` defines the location of two rather important files inspected at start-up: ```rootalias.C``` and ```rootlogon.C```. They can contain code that needs to be loaded and executed at ROOT startup. ```rootalias.C``` is only loaded and best used to define some often used functions. rootlogon.C contains code that will be executed at startup: this file is extremely useful for example to pre-load a custom style for the plots created with ROOT. This is done most easily by creating a new TStyle object with your preferred settings, as described in the class reference guide, and then use the command ```gROOT->SetStyle(\"MyStyleName\");``` to make this new style definition the default one. As an example, have a look in the file rootlogon.C coming with this tutorial. Another relevant file is ```rootlogoff.C``` that is called when the session is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 ROOT command history\n",
    "\n",
    "Every command typed at the ROOT prompt is stored in the file ```.root_hist``` in your home directory. ROOT uses this file to allow for navigation in the command history with the up-arrow and down-arrow keys. It is also convenient to extract successful ROOT commands with the help of a text editor for use in your own macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.4 ROOT Global Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "All global pointers in ROOT begin with a small “g”. Some of them were already implicitly introduced (for example in the section Configure ROOT at start-up). The most important among them are presented in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[gROOT](http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TROOT.html):** the ```gROOT``` variable is the entry point to the ```ROOT``` system. Technically it is an instance of the ```TROOT``` class. Using the gROOT pointer one has access to basically every object created in a ROOT based program. The ```TROOT``` object is essentially a container of several lists pointing to the main ```ROOT``` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[gStyle](http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TStyle.html):** By default ROOT creates a default style that can be accessed via the ```gStyle``` pointer. This class includes functions to set some of the following object attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Canvas\n",
    "    * Pad\n",
    "    * Histogram axis\n",
    "    * Lines\n",
    "    * Fill areas\n",
    "    * Text\n",
    "    * Markers\n",
    "    * Functions\n",
    "    * Histogram Statistics and Titles\n",
    "    * etc …\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[gSystem](http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TSystem.html):** An instance of a base class defining a generic interface to the underlying Operating System, in our case ```TUnixSystem```.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[gInterpreter](http://root.cern.ch/htmldoc/html/TInterpreter.html):** The entry point for the ROOT interpreter. Technically an abstraction level over a singleton instance of ```TCling```.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you have already learned quite a bit about some basic features of ROOT."
